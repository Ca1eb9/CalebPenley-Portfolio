# Caleb Penley's Work Portfolio
This is my work portfolio â€“ a curated showcase of projects in software engineering, data science, algorithms, UX/UI design, web development, and more, highlighting skills developed throughout my coursework and personal projects.

## Welcome!
I am a passionate and driven individual with a love for challenges and pushing the limits of what is deemed possible. I am currently a computer science student pursuing a B.S. at the Pennsylvania State University. In my freetime, I like to socialize and make new connections, play games, workout, and program of course. I have a variety of interests but my computer science ones consist of software, hardware, AI, IoT, networking, and much more. I am currently researching and developing ways to revolutionize our use of AI and the rest of technology.

My work has been catagorized into the folders above. The work ranges from beginner code to full fledged programs currently in use in the industry.

## Work in Progress!!
Keep in mind that this portfolio is a work in progress and I am actively reorganizing and improving this repository on a weekly basis or when I have time.

Thank you!
