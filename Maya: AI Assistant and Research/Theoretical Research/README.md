### Overview
- This is my more theoretical research into AI using advanced methods. 
- I am attempting to create a better AI more suited for this complex world using novel techniques centered around theories of the human conciousness.

### Technologies
- Python, Miro, Wandb, panda, Hugging Face, NLP models including those of transformers, and more

## What I learned
- Optimization is an important subject when working with mathematical models to not avoid overfitting and improve efficiency
- How to finetune a state-of-the-art NLP model for deductive reasoning
- How different types of dropout can change how the model trains
- How complex the frameworks and networks are that could model the human brain
- How models use high-dimensional vector similarity to accurately predict 


## Future Improvements
- I plan to start programming these novel mechanisms very soon
