### Overview
- This is my more theoretical research into AI using advanced methods. 
- I am attempting to create a better AI more suited for this complex world using novel techniques centered around theories of the human conciousness.

### Technologies
- Python, Miro, Wandb, panda, Hugging Face, NLP models including those of transformers, and more

## What I learned
- Optimization is an important subject when working with mathematical models to not avoid overfitting and improve efficiency
- We are currently at the forefront of AI research, and a open-minded and diverse team is integral to creating a revolutionary advancement
- As with most things, machine learning is not a simple path, rather a perplex methodology filled with endless combiniations

## Future Improvements
- I plan to start programming these novel mechanisms very soon
