# Maya Experimental Project: an original AI assistant

### Overview
This project is mainly functional programming as I had not yet learned OOP at the time of development. There is also beginner use of machine learning as I had not even taken pre-calculus as of development.

## What I learned
- How important object-orientated programming is while working with complex interconnected systems
- How to decide what types of computations are happening at the client vs. server level to drastically aid in efficiency of the overall program
- How several different technologies can be used to develop a cohesive and succesful program
- How important reaching out and asking questions are, especially with a team in mind

## Future Improvements
- With more knowledge and understanding, I plan rework everything and integrate it with the models I develop from my theoretical research
