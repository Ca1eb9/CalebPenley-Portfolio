# Code Golf in Python

### Overview
- My submissions for my python classes' code golf challenges
- The competitions were extracurricular and worth extra credit 
- These submissions all typically awarded me with 1st - 3rd place among my peers

### Technologies
- Python

## What I learned
- Most solutions to problems are not the "best" they could be even if it does not seem obvious
- The sky is the limit and boundaries are meant to be broken, there is almost never a problem not worth trying to solve better even if everyone else thinks they've done it
