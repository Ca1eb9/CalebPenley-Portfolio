# Coursework in data structures in Python

### Overview
- Coursework from the data structures class last semester focused on creating and using more complex data structures.

### Technologies
- Python
- Algorithms such as sorting and searching (with and without recursion)
- Data structures such as linked lists, queues, and stacks

## What I learned
- Complex algorithms can be easily developed using a thoughtful and structured approach
- Data structures can be developed to aid in program creation, allowing for more cohesive and understandable solutions
- Even simple data structures can be used in a vast amount of different ways
- Python's class and inheritance structure are very useful when working with complex data and algorithms
- Algorithms can be solved in a variety of ways but it is important to consider time and space complexity
